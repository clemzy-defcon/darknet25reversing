Here is sample python subprocess code to help you debug local runs


#!/usr/bin/python
import subprocess 
binary = "\x11\x22\x33\x44"
binary += "\x55\x66\x77\x88"

p = subprocess.Popen(["/path/to/bin"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout.subprocess.PIPE, bufsize=0)

# neat little trick, this lets you pause execution until you press enter...
# you could use this to, for example, take a moment to attach gdb to the newly
# launched copy of /path/to/bin before throwing your exploit... ;]
raw_input() 


# read output 
output = p.stdout.readline()
print output 

# write to stdin
while True:
  p.stdin.write(raw_input() + "\n")
  print p.stdout.readline()
